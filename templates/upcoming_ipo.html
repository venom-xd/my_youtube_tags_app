        <h2> IPO Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
        <h3>1. What is an IPO?</h3>
        <p>
            An Initial Public Offering (IPO) is the process through which a private company offers its shares to the public for the first time. This allows the company to raise capital from public investors.
        </p>
        
        <h3>2. Why do companies go public?</h3>
        <p>
            Companies go public to raise funds for expansion, pay off debt, or increase their visibility in the marketplace. Being listed on a stock exchange also enhances a company’s credibility.
        </p>
    
        <h3>3. What is the process of investing in an IPO?</h3>
        <p>
            Investors can participate in an IPO by applying for shares through their brokerage accounts. There is usually a specified period during which investors can submit their applications.
        </p>
    
        <h3>4. What are the risks associated with IPO investments?</h3>
        <p>
            IPOs can be volatile and carry risks. The company’s future performance is uncertain, and new public companies might not have a track record to evaluate. Investors should conduct thorough research before investing.
        </p>
    
        <h3>5. How are IPO prices determined?</h3>
        <p>
            IPO prices are typically set by the underwriters based on factors like company valuation, market conditions, and investor demand. This process often involves roadshows and discussions with potential investors.
        </p>
    
        <h3>6. Can I sell my shares immediately after an IPO?</h3>
        <p>
            In many cases, there are lock-up periods during which investors cannot sell their shares right after the IPO. This period usually lasts from 30 to 180 days, depending on the company and underwriters' agreements.
